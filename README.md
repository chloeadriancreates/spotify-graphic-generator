## Presentation
This is an app I made in order to create graphics for podcast episodes from Spotify. I listen to a lot of Dungeons & Dragons podcasts, and I like tracking which episodes I've listened. Up until now, I took a screenshot when I finished an episode and added it to my tracker, but it was honestly cumbersome, and I could rarely see the entire episode title – so I built this in order to easily have access to clean graphics to add to my tracker instead! You can see the entire app [here](https://spotifygraphicgenerator.chloeadrian.dev)!
